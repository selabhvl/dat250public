## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 3

### Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to make initial experiments with front-end technologies for enterprise applications.
Your goal is develop web-based graphical user interface for your REST API from [last week](./expass2.md),
which allows to _create a user_, _create a poll_, _vote on a poll_. 
The GUI shall be realised as a _Single Page Application (SPA)_, comprising three components: `CreateUserComponent`, `CreatePollComponent`,
`VoteComponent`.

You can use the SPA-library/framework of your choice.
The potential candidates are:

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

You can use the library/framework that you like the most/that you are most familiar with.
If you are not familiar with any of them, we recommend you to use svelte, which is also covered in the lecture.

### Step 1: Set up Node project

### Step 2: Develop components 

### Step 3: Enable CORS on the server side (for testing purposes)

### Step 4: Integrate frontend and backend via `fetch`

### Step 5: Deploy

### Step 6: Extensions (optional)

- Server-sent updates in votes via WebSockets
- GraphQL API




### Hand-in: short report

As hand-in, you must add a markdown file called `dat250-expass6.md` to the same repository that you created in the earlier software technology assignments.

In particular, you should write about:

- technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial

- a link to your code for experiments 1-2 above

- any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

The hand-in should be written in **English**.
